Personal Website for my developer portfolio.

### Getting started

1. Install required dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Remove `homepage` entirely from `package.json` or set it to single dot. 
3. If running node > 16, run `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`
4. `npm run start` project and customize it.
